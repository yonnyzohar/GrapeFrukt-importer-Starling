GrapeFrukt-importer-Starling
============================

A starling version for importing Grapefrukt animations

The Grapefrukt exporter is the best software i've come accross in exporting animations for mobile projects. 
found here: https://github.com/grapefrukt/grapefrukt-export

once the project is exported to images and xml files, use this importer to bring them back for use inStarling.

currently suitible for use only with AnimationNodeMatrix class. 
Works amazing on AIR projects compiled to ios and Android.
